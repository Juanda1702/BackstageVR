# XR Hand Capture

**XR Hand Capture** enables developers to quickly create custom hand shapes for XR applications. With this feature, you can record hand data on supported XR devices, import the recordings into the Unity Editor, and create reusable [XRHandShape](xref:xrhands-hand-shapes) assets. This streamlined workflow accelerates gesture-based interaction development, making it simple to add custom hand gestures to your Unity projects.
